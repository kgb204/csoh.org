# How to Use the CSOH Cloud Security News RSS Feed

## What Is RSS?

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a way to get updates from websites delivered straight to you — no need to keep checking the site manually. Think of it like subscribing to a newsletter, but instead of email, the updates go to a feed reader app of your choice.

## Our Feed URL

```
https://csoh.org/feed.xml
```

This feed contains the latest cloud security news curated by Cloud Security Office Hours, covering AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes vulnerabilities, breaches, and more. It updates automatically whenever new articles are added to our [news page](https://csoh.org/news.html).

## Getting Started (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Pick a Feed Reader

A feed reader is an app that collects and displays RSS feeds for you. Here are some popular free options:

| Reader | Platform | Link |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Feedly** | Web, iOS, Android | [feedly.com](https://feedly.com) |
| **Inoreader** | Web, iOS, Android | [inoreader.com](https://www.inoreader.com) |
| **NetNewsWire** | macOS, iOS | [netnewswire.com](https://netnewswire.com) |
| **Thunderbird** | Windows, macOS, Linux | [thunderbird.net](https://www.thunderbird.net) |
| **Newsblur** | Web, iOS, Android | [newsblur.com](https://newsblur.com) |

Don't overthink it — any of these will work. Feedly is the most beginner-friendly.

### Step 2: Add Our Feed

1. Open your feed reader.
2. Look for an **"Add Feed"**, **"Subscribe"**, or **"+"** button.
3. Paste in our feed URL:
   ```
   https://csoh.org/feed.xml
   ```
4. Confirm / click Subscribe.

That's it. New cloud security articles will now show up in your reader automatically.

### Step 3: Read Your Feed

Open your feed reader whenever you want to catch up. New articles appear in a simple list with the title, source, and a short summary. Click any article to read the full story on the original site.

## FAQ

### How often does the feed update?
The feed updates whenever new articles are added to the CSOH news page. This is typically daily on weekdays.

### Is the feed free?
Yes, completely free. You don't need an account on our site.

### Can I use RSS in Slack or Teams?
Yes! Both Slack and Microsoft Teams support RSS:

- **Slack**: Use the `/feed subscribe https://csoh.org/feed.xml` command in any channel (requires the RSS app to be installed in your workspace).
- **Microsoft Teams**: Add the "RSS" connector to a channel and paste the feed URL.

### Can I use RSS with email?
Services like [Blogtrottr](https://blogtrottr.com) or [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) can send RSS updates to your inbox if you prefer email over a dedicated reader.

### What if my browser opens the feed as raw XML?
That's normal — feed URLs are meant to be opened in a feed reader, not a browser. Just copy the URL and paste it into your reader app instead.
