"""Generate per-page Open Graph (social-share) images.

Renders a CSOH-branded 1200×630 image for each page in PAGES, saves them
under ../img/og/<slug>.jpg, and rewrites each page's <meta property="og:image">
+ <meta name="twitter:image"> to point at the new file.

Idempotent - re-running regenerates images for any page whose content
might have changed; pages whose OG image is already set to the per-page
version won't get a redundant URL update.

Usage:
    python3 tools/generate_og_images.py
    python3 tools/generate_og_images.py --pages index.html ctfs.html
    python3 tools/generate_og_images.py --skip-html       # only regenerate jpgs

#
# To add a page: append a (filename, title, subtitle, badge) tuple in the
# matching section below. For a subdirectory page use the relative path
# (e.g. "breaches/foo.html"); the JPG is written alongside at
# img/og/breaches/foo.jpg. Then run: python3 tools/generate_og_images.py
# --pages breaches/foo.html   (regenerates just that one image).
