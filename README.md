- Community overview and value proposition
- Featured resource categories with quick navigation
- Call-to-action buttons for mailing list signup (which delivers the Zoom link)
- Enhanced schema markup for improved SERP visibility
- Testimonials and member count (2000+)

### ☁️ What is Cloud Security? (`what-is-cloud-security.html`)
Vendor-neutral pillar page introducing the field - shared responsibility model, core pillars, top threats, the CSPM/CNAPP/CWPP/CIEM tool landscape, and a pointer-rich getting-started roadmap. Targets the high-volume "what is cloud security" search query and serves as the hub that links into the rest of the site. FAQ schema for rich snippets.

### 🛣️ Learning Path (`learning-path.html`)
Step-by-step roadmap from "no cloud experience" to working practitioner: prerequisites, beginner / intermediate / advanced stages with milestones, specialization tracks, and a "stay current" rhythm. Marked up with `HowTo` schema. Built from what actually works for the 2000+ members of the community.

### 🎓 Cloud Security Degree Programs (`cloud-security-degree-programs.html`)
Academic paths for cloud security: when a degree pays off, degree types and what they fit, what to look for in a program, NSA/CISA CAE and equivalent designations, named US universities (research, federal-track, applied), online and professional master's, and international programs (UK, EU, Canada, Australia, Israel, Asia). FAQ schema.

### 🧭 Cloud Security Careers (`cloud-security-careers.html`)
Roles and salary bands, what hiring managers actually look for, interview formats, portfolio projects, and how to translate from adjacent roles. FAQ schema. The careers hub fans out to a **role-in-depth series** and a **portfolio-projects hub** (below).

### 🧑‍💼 Career Roles, In Depth (`cloud-security-*.html`)
A series of one-page-per-role deep dives covering day-to-day work, the skills that actually matter, salary signals, and how to break in: Cloud Security Engineer, Cloud Security Architect (Staff+ IC), IAM / Identity Architect, Cloud AppSec / IaC Security Engineer, CSPM / CNAPP Analyst, Cloud Detection Engineer, Cloud Incident Responder (DFIR), Cloud Penetration Tester / Red Team, Security SRE / Platform Security Engineer, Cloud GRC / Compliance Engineer, Cloud Security Sales Engineer, and Cloud Security Customer Success Engineer. Each role page carries FAQ schema.

### 🛠️ Cloud Security Portfolio Projects (`cloud-security-portfolio-projects.html` + `portfolio/`)
A hub of build-it-yourself projects that demonstrate real cloud-security skill to hiring managers, each with a full step-by-step walkthrough under `portfolio/`: build a multi-account AWS Org with SCPs, walk every CloudGoat scenario, write a CNAPP comparison, build 5 detections in a lab SIEM, run a Prowler audit and Terraform the fixes, recreate the Capital One breach end to end, and ship a first OSS contribution to a cloud-security project.

### 🪜 Breaking Into Cloud Security (`breaking-into-cloud-security.html`)
The realistic transition from IT support / help desk into cloud security: what actually transfers, what you have to build from scratch, and the sequence that works. This page absorbed three earlier entry-path pages (`is-cloud-security-a-good-career.html`, `get-into-cloud-security-no-experience.html`, `help-desk-to-cloud-security.html`); the old URLs 301 in `.htaccess` and `retire_merged_career_pages.py` repointed every in-site link so there is no redirect hop.

### 🧪 Cloud Security Home Lab Walk-throughs (`homelab/`)
Deep, command-line-level lab walkthroughs that go further than the home-lab overview page: break-and-detect on AWS, a CloudTrail → SIEM detection pipeline, a Kubernetes security lab, and a LocalStack AWS lab. Registered like `portfolio/` in `sync_chrome.py`, the validators, and lychee; deliberately **not** in the site search index.

### 🎤 Interview Prep (`cloud-security-interview-questions.html`, `cloud-security-resume-guide.html`)
Two companion pages to the careers hub: interview questions with model answers (what a good answer sounds like, not just the question list), and a resume guide covering structure, phrasing, and what hiring managers actually scan for.

### 📖 Cloud Security Reading List (`cloud-security-reading-list.html`)
A hand-curated, opinionated list of books, blogs, podcasts, newsletters, and people to follow. A monthly GitHub Actions workflow (`check-reading-list-staleness.yml`) discovers each source's feed and flags anything that has gone quiet - it never edits the page, only files a tracking issue for a human to review.

### ✅ Cloud Security Best Practices (`cloud-security-best-practices.html`)
Practitioner's checklist of the controls that actually prevent breaches, ordered by what shows up as root cause in our breach kill chains. Covers identity, configuration, network, data, detection, supply chain, workloads, AI, governance - plus an explicit "anti-patterns" section.

### ⚖️ Shared Responsibility Model (`shared-responsibility-model.html`)
What the cloud provider secures vs. what you secure across IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and FaaS. Includes the AWS / Azure / GCP differences (and Google's "shared fate" extension), a per-service-tier table, the contractual layer, and the gotchas behind every "who's responsible for X?" argument.

### 🛠️ CSPM vs CNAPP vs CWPP vs CIEM vs DSPM (`cspm-vs-cnapp.html`)
The acronym soup decoded. Side-by-side comparison of cloud-security tool categories with explicit "when do I need each" guidance, an open-source-only reference stack, and an FAQ on whether CNAPP is "just marketing" (mostly: no).

### 🔍 Focused Category Comparisons (`cspm-vs-cwpp.html`, `cnapp-vs-xdr.html`)
Two narrower head-to-heads for the questions the big comparison page gets asked repeatedly: posture vs. workload protection (CSPM vs CWPP), and where CNAPP ends and XDR/CDR begins.

### 📦 Containers & Cloud Security (`containers.html`)
Vendor-neutral guide to containers in the cloud - what they actually are, why the boundary is process-isolation rather than tenant-isolation, the real escape paths (privileged flags, kernel CVEs, hostPath, docker.sock), identity chaining via the instance metadata service, flat networking, supply chain, minimal/hardened base images (Chainguard, Minimus, Wiz, Distroless), runtime detection, and an AWS/Azure/GCP service comparison.

### ⚡ Serverless Functions & Cloud Security (`serverless.html`)
Practitioner's guide to AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions - what they are, when to use them, the good/bad tradeoffs, and the seven security risk categories: event injection from S3/SQS/HTTP triggers, identity sprawl across per-function roles, supply-chain risk, secrets handling, network egress, denial of wallet, and the observability gap.

### 🔄 CI/CD for Cloud Deployments (`ci-cd.html`)
Vendor-neutral CI/CD reference focused on cloud - pipeline anatomy, OIDC federation (replacing long-lived cloud keys), AWS / Azure / GCP per-cloud deep dives, deployment strategies (blue/green, canary, rolling), securing the pipeline itself, IaC in the pipeline, and the DORA-aligned bootstrapping path.

### 🛰️ Cloud SOC & Threat Monitoring (`cloud-soc.html`)
Cloud-side detection and response - how cloud SOC differs from packet-driven traditional SOC, the log sources that matter (CloudTrail / Activity Log / Cloud Audit Logs, identity events, VPC flow, DNS, data plane), native cloud detection (GuardDuty / Defender for Cloud / SCC), the modern SIEM landscape (Splunk, Sentinel, Chronicle, Elastic, CrowdStrike, Datadog), detection engineering as a practice, MITRE-mapped detection categories, threat intel, IR specifics, and a 4-stage SOC maturity model.

### 🔐 IAM & Cloud Identity (`iam.html`)
Cloud identity is the #1 root-cause category in breach reports. This page covers federation (SAML/OIDC/SCIM), RBAC vs ABAC vs ReBAC, JIT access and PAM, workload identity (IRSA / Workload Identity Federation / Managed Identities), and the per-cloud privilege-escalation paths (`iam:PassRole`, AssumeRole chains, GCP service-account impersonation, Azure managed-identity abuse). FAQ schema.

### 🤖 Non-Human Identity (`non-human-identity.html`)
The identity class that now outnumbers humans by an order of magnitude: service accounts, workload identities, API keys, tokens, and increasingly AI agents. Discovery, ownership, lifecycle, rotation, and why the usual IAM playbook doesn't transfer cleanly.

### 🛡️ Zero Trust Architecture (`zero-trust.html`)
NIST SP 800-207 explained, the BeyondCorp origin story, the seven tenets, PDP/PEP/Policy Engine, ZTNA vs VPN, microsegmentation (host-based vs network-based vs service-mesh), continuous verification, CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model, and per-cloud patterns for AWS / Azure / GCP. Explicitly debunks "Zero Trust as a product."

### 🐛 Cloud Vulnerability Management (`vulnerability-management.html`)
CVSS is not a priority score. The prioritization stack: CVSS → EPSS → KEV → reachability → asset criticality. SCA, SAST, DAST, container image scanning, IaC scanning, agentless vs agent-based cloud scanners, SBOM (CycloneDX/SPDX), VEX, runtime detection (eBPF), patch management in cloud, ASPM, and SLAs by severity.

### 🔌 API Security (`api-security.html`)
OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023) walked end to end - BOLA, broken auth, BOPLA, unrestricted resource consumption, BFLA, business-flow abuse, SSRF, misconfig, inventory drift, unsafe consumption.

Provider testing policies, RoE, methodology (PTES / ATT&CK / Hacking the Cloud), per-cloud attack paths (AWS / Azure / GCP / Kubernetes), the open-source toolkit catalog (Pacu, ROADtools, BloodHound, Cloudfox, MicroBurst, Stratus Red Team, CloudGoat, AzureHound). Explicit authorized-testing-only banner.

### 📜 GRC for Cloud (`grc.html`)
Governance, Risk, Compliance - the discipline that makes cloud security legible to auditors and regulators. Three pillars, framework landscape (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, FedRAMP, NIST CSF, CIS, GDPR), policy-as-code, compliance-as-code, continuous compliance with CSPM/CNAPP, audit evidence in cloud, AWS Audit Manager vs Azure Policy vs GCP Assured Workloads.

### 📋 Compliance Frameworks in Cloud (`compliance-frameworks.html`)
The deep-dive companion to GRC: framework-by-framework breakdowns (SOC 2 Type I/II, ISO 27001/27017/27018, PCI DSS v4, HIPAA, FedRAMP Low/Mod/High + 20x, CMMC 2.0, NIST CSF 2.0, NIST SP 800-53/171, CIS Benchmarks, GDPR, SOX, NIS2, DORA, plus industry-specific). Control crosswalks, GRC platform landscape, and AWS / Azure / GCP compliance program comparison.

### 🤖 AI/ML & LLM Security (`ai-ml-security.html`)
Securing AI workloads (distinct from `ai-learning.html`, which is about using AI to learn cloud security). OWASP LLM Top 10 walked item by item, OWASP ML Top 10, prompt-injection defenses, agentic AI risks, model supply chain, training-data security, vector DB and RAG security, AI governance frameworks (NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001, MITRE ATLAS), and per-cloud AI service controls.

### 🔌 MCP Security (`mcp-security.html`)
Securing the Model Context Protocol - the tool-calling layer AI assistants now use to reach real systems. Trust boundaries between model, client, and server; prompt-injection reaching a tool call; credential and scope handling; and what to check before you connect an MCP server to anything that matters.

### 🕸️ Service Mesh Security (`service-mesh-security.html`)
Securing east-west traffic. Istio / Linkerd / Cilium / Consul Connect, mTLS, authentication (SPIFFE/SPIRE workload identity), authorization policy, observability (Hubble, Kiali), sidecar vs sidecarless (ambient mode, eBPF), multi-cluster meshes, mesh attack surface, AWS App Mesh / Anthos Service Mesh / AKS Istio add-on.

### 📐 Landing Zones & Cloud Foundations (`landing-zones.html`)
The foundation layer - AWS Control Tower + Organizations + SCPs, Azure CAF Enterprise-scale + Management Groups + Azure Policy, GCP Org → Folders → Projects + Org Policies + VPC Service Controls. Account-vault patterns, identity layer placement, tagging strategy.

### 🟧 AWS Security Hub (`aws-security.html`)
SEO-targeted hub page for the "AWS security" search intent (~10× the volume of "cloud security"). Well-Architected Security pillar, the full AWS service catalog (detection / identity / data / network / compliance / IR), reference landing-zone architecture, top-10 AWS misconfigurations, AWS attack paths, and discipline cross-links with `#aws` anchors.

### 🟦 Azure Security Hub (`azure-security.html`)
Same SEO play for Azure. CAF Secure methodology, the Microsoft service catalog (Defender for Cloud / Sentinel / Entra ID / Purview / Key Vault / Front Door / NSGs), Entra-ID-vs-traditional-AD, Azure attack paths (managed identity abuse, illicit consent grants, Conditional Access bypass), and the Microsoft Defender licensing maze.

### 🟩 GCP Security Hub (`gcp-security.html`)
Same SEO play for Google Cloud. Encryption-by-default story, Security Command Center Standard/Premium/Enterprise, BeyondCorp Enterprise, VPC Service Controls deep-dive, GCP attack paths (service-account impersonation, deployment-manager privesc, metadata SSH-key injection), and Assured Workloads.

### ⚖️ AWS vs Azure vs GCP Security Services (`cloud-security-comparison.html`)
The definitive vendor-neutral comparison. Ten side-by-side `.comparison-table` blocks (identity, detection, data, network, compliance, pricing, customer identity, compute, container, serverless), conceptual differences that bite you (IAM-policy languages, org-boundary models, log pricing, VPC SC), a "which cloud for which job" guidance section, and a 20-row score-card summary.

### 🗺️ Vendor Landscape (`vendor-landscape.html`)
A directory of **<!--count:vendors_floor-->300+<!--/count--> cloud-security vendors** across <!--count:vendor_categories-->32<!--/count--> categories - CNAPP, CSPM, KSPM, CIEM, SSPM, DSPM, SIEM, EDR/XDR, MDR, SOAR, ASPM, SAST/SCA, IaC scanning, secrets, PAM, IdP, WAF/DDoS, API security, CASB, SASE, ZTNA, DevSecOps, image hardening, supply chain, AI security, vuln mgmt, forensics, MSSPs, GRC platforms. Vendor-neutral one-liners, no rankings. Wiz affiliation disclosed.

### 🔍 Site Search (`search.html`)
[MiniSearch](https://lucaong.github.io/minisearch/)-powered full-text search across every page, with **section-anchor results** and **synonym expansion**. `tools/build_search_index.py` builds `search-index.json` at deploy time (one entry per `<section id>` + one per glossary term), `search-init.js` lazy-loads it on first keystroke, and `search-synonyms.json` maps acronyms to expansions so `NHI` finds every "non-human identity" mention site-wide. CSP stays strict - `script-src 'self'`, no `unsafe-eval`, no `wasm-unsafe-eval`.

### ⚙️ How We Use GitHub Actions (`github-actions.html`)
Learn-by-example explainer for GitHub Actions, using CSOH's workflow files as the teaching material. Covers triggers, concurrency, secrets, the GITHUB_TOKEN vs PAT distinction, the `workflow` scope gotcha, OIDC trust to GCP, and a recommended reading order through the workflow files - every one of which is commented line by line (roughly half of each file is explanatory comments) specifically so a newcomer can read it top to bottom and understand it.

### ☁️ How We Deploy Across AWS, GCP & Azure (`cloud-deployment.html`)
The dogfooded multi-cloud architecture: one static site served active/active from AWS (S3 + CloudFront), GCP (Cloud Run), and Azure (Blob static website) behind a single Cloudflare edge (TLS, WAF, security headers, redirects, Load Balancer with health-check failover), deployed to each cloud with keyless OIDC. Security controls called out at every layer. Pairs with the GitHub Actions explainer to give a complete CI/CD-to-cloud reference.

### 🧱 How We Use Terraform (`terraform.html`)
Learn-by-example IaC explainer, using the Terraform that provisions CSOH's own multi-cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure, Cloudflare) as the teaching material. Every `.tf` file under `infra/terraform/` is exhaustively commented inline - roughly two of every three lines is a comment, and even core Terraform vocabulary ("resource" vs "data", providers, state, dependencies) is explained in place - specifically so a complete newcomer can read the multi-cloud build end to end and understand it. The third leg of the "Behind the Scenes" developer-docs set alongside GitHub Actions and the multi-cloud deploy page.

### 🔀 Git & Version Control (`version-control.html`)
Version-control fundamentals - branching, commits, pull requests, and history hygiene - taught through this repository's own workflow.

### 🔐 How csoh.org Is Secured (`how-csoh-org-is-secured.html`)
The site's own security model as a worked example: the strict CSP and the rest of the security-header set, SRI on every shared asset, keyless OIDC deploys with no long-lived cloud credentials, the GitHub App / PAT split in CI, the URL-safety and broken-link gates, and the WAF and edge controls in front of all three origins. The fourth "Behind the Scenes" page - it is the security counterpart to the deploy, Actions, and Terraform explainers.

The recurring root causes across all of these are synthesized in **[breach-lessons.html](https://csoh.org/breach-lessons.html)**, and the incidents that defined this past year are collected in the **[2025 Cloud Breach Year in Review](https://csoh.org/cloud-breach-year-in-review-2025.html)**.

### How to contribute a kill chain

See **[CONTRIBUTING_KILL_CHAINS.md](CONTRIBUTING_KILL_CHAINS.md)** for the full guide including:
- What qualifies as a good kill chain entry
- A list of candidate incidents with good post-mortems
- The HTML template to copy for a new entry
- The quality checklist before submitting

To **nominate an incident** without writing it yourself, open an issue using the **"🔗 New Kill Chain Request"** template.

### The standard

Kill chain entries require:
- A real post-mortem or official technical disclosure (vendor blog, CISA advisory, court documents)
- Step-by-step technical detail - not just a summary
- Every step mapped to a MITRE ATT&CK Cloud technique
- Actionable defender recommendations tied to specific controls

This is intentionally high-bar. A small number of deeply researched entries is more valuable than many shallow ones.

### How to contribute a source

Edit `threat-research.html` directly - each link is a standard `.resource-card` in the same format as `resources.html` and `presentations.html`. Open a PR with:

- A link to the primary research output (blog index, report landing page, or feed URL - not a marketing page)
- A one-sentence description of what's unique about the source
- 2-3 tags (use existing tag classes where possible: `ctf`, `tool`, `lab`, `certification`, `job`, `ai-security`, `new`)

### The `tools/` directory

Every script is stdlib-first, idempotent, and only writes when content actually changes (see [DEVELOPMENT.md → Scripts must only write when content actually changes](DEVELOPMENT.md#scripts-must-only-write-when-content-actually-changes)). Scripts with a `_README.md` beside them have long-form docs; the rest are documented by their module docstring.

**Content ingest (interactive or credentialed)**

| `crosslink_pages.py` | Links the first occurrence of each glossary term across the rest of the site | [README](tools/CROSSLINK_PAGES_README.md) |
| `glossary_terms.py` | Shared headword parsing behind both cross-linkers - one answer to "what strings link to this `<dt>`?", after two drifting copies each carried a bug the other had fixed | docstring |
| `inject_meeting_topic_links.py` | Injects contextual topic-page links into recap bodies | [README](tools/INJECT_MEETING_TOPIC_LINKS_README.md) |
| `inject_session_blocks.py` | Stamps a "From the Friday sessions" block onto topic pages | [README](tools/INJECT_SESSION_BLOCKS_README.md) |
| `inject_goatcounter.py` | Stamps the GoatCounter analytics tag onto every page | docstring |
| `update_presentations_schema.py` | Regenerates the `VideoObject` JSON-LD on `presentations.html` | [README](tools/UPDATE_PRESENTATIONS_SCHEMA_README.md) |
| `update_sitemap.py` | Refreshes `<lastmod>` in `sitemap.xml` (does **not** discover new pages) | [README](tools/UPDATE_SITEMAP_README.md) |
| `normalize_urls.py` | Strips tracking params, upgrades http→https, resolves redirects | docstring |
| `../update_sri.py` | Recomputes SRI hashes + `?v=` cache-bust keys for every shared asset | [README](tools/UPDATE_SRI_README.md) |
| `../update_news.py` | Pulls 62 RSS feeds → `news.html`, `feed.xml`, sitemap lastmod | [README](tools/UPDATE_NEWS_README.md) |

**Generated artifacts (indexes, feeds, images)**

| Script | What it does | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| `build_search_index.py` | Builds `search-index.json` (one entry per `<section id>` + glossary term) | docstring |
| `build_meetings_search_index.py` | Builds `meetings-search-index.json` over full recap text | docstring |
| `generate_rss.py` | Rebuilds `feed.xml` from `news.html` | docstring |

| `wrap_img_webp.py` | Wraps `<img>` in `<picture>` with a WebP `<source>` | docstring |

**CI gates and audits (report or fail, never edit content)**

| Script | What it does | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| `check_all_site_urls.py` | Site-wide URL safety scan (phishing patterns, suspicious TLDs, shorteners) | [README](tools/CHECK_URL_SAFETY_README.md) |
| `check_url_safety.py` | The single-URL validator `check_all_site_urls.py` is built on | [README](tools/CHECK_URL_SAFETY_README.md) |
| `check_jsonld.py` | Every JSON-LD block on the site must be valid JSON | docstring |
| `check_no_inline_scripts.py` | No inline `<script>` blocks (the CSP forbids them) | docstring |
| `check_svg_dimensions.py` | `width`/`height` on every `<svg>` that has a `viewBox` | docstring |
| `check_crosslink_coverage.py` | Every root page is either cross-linked or explicitly opted out - `crosslink_pages.py` skips unlisted pages silently, so omissions never surfaced | docstring |
| `check_glossary_coverage.py` | Glossary invariants: unique `<dt>` ids, no alias claimed by two entries, anchors resolve, no unreachable entry added by accident | docstring |
| `check_docs_consistency.py` | The mechanical half of the weekly documentation review: visible dates vs JSON-LD, social-card assets, false count claims, glossary orphans. Fixes what is derivable, reports the rest, deletes nothing | [README](tools/DOCS_CONSISTENCY_README.md) |
| `check_news_banners.py` | Every news source has an on-disk banner image | docstring |
| `sync_dark_branch.py` | Keeps `style.css`'s two dark branches in step - the `[data-theme="dark"]` toggle branch and the `prefers-color-scheme` system branch, which is what a dark-OS visitor renders through before `main.js` runs (and permanently, with JS off). `--check` for CI | docstring |
| `check_mobile_layout.py` | Mobile layout regression check | docstring |
| `run_seo_audit.py` | Deterministic structural SEO audit → `seo-audits/` + SCORECARD | [README](tools/RUN_SEO_AUDIT_README.md) |
| `check_pagespeed.py` | Google PageSpeed Insights (mobile + desktop) → SCORECARD | [README](tools/CHECK_PAGESPEED_README.md) |
| `check_lighthouse.py` | Lighthouse SEO / a11y / perf threshold check | [README](tools/CHECK_LIGHTHOUSE_README.md) |
| `check_edge_headers.py` | Asserts the live security headers match `rules.tf` - the Cloudflare ruleset is inert after creation, so Terraform cannot catch drift | [README](tools/CHECK_EDGE_HEADERS_README.md) |
| `check_robots_parity.py` | Asserts the live `robots.txt` matches the repo, catching an edge-injected managed `robots.txt` | [README](tools/CHECK_ROBOTS_PARITY_README.md) |
| `check_reading_list_staleness.py` | Flags reading-list sources that stopped publishing | [README](tools/CHECK_READING_LIST_STALENESS_README.md) |
| `check_meeting_staleness.py` | Flags a stalled meeting-recap cadence | docstring |
| `check_conference_staleness.py` | Flags conference "Next:" dates that have gone stale | docstring |

**Build / packaging**

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `stage_site.sh` | Produces `dist/` - the exact public file set every origin serves |
| `site-publish.filter` | rsync filter listing what `stage_site.sh` includes and excludes |
| `url_resolution_cache.json` | CI-seeded redirect cache for `normalize_urls.py` (never commit a local copy) |

## 🛠️ Managing Content

### Adding a New Resource

**Fastest option:** Run `python3 tools/submit_resource.py` to add a resource interactively.
**Script guide:** [tools/SUBMIT_RESOURCE_README.md](tools/SUBMIT_RESOURCE_README.md)

1. **Open `resources.html`** in your editor
2. **Locate the appropriate section** (CTF, Labs, Tools, etc.)
3. **Add a new resource card** before the closing `</div>` of the section:

```html
<a href="https://resource-url.com" target="_blank" class="card-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <div class="resource-card" data-tooltip="Extended 2-3 sentence description shown on hover. Cover what makes it unique, who benefits most, and prerequisites or cost.">
        <img src="img/previews/resource-url.com.jpg" alt="Preview" class="resource-preview">
        <h3>Resource Name</h3>
        <p>Brief description of what this resource offers and why it's valuable for cloud security professionals.</p>
        <div class="resource-tags">
            <span class="tag">AWS</span>
            <span class="tag">Security</span>
            <span class="tag new">NEW</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</a>
```

**Preview images:** If you do not have a preview image, the workflow will automatically capture a screenshot and update `preview-mapping.json` after you open a PR.

4. **Commit and push** to update the live site

### Adding a New Article to News

News articles are **updated automatically** - you don't need to add them by hand. A GitHub Actions workflow runs every 3 hours, pulls articles from 62 cloud security RSS feeds, and creates a pull request with the new content. See the [How Automation Works](#-how-automation-works) section below for details, or read the full docs in [tools/UPDATE_NEWS_README.md](tools/UPDATE_NEWS_README.md).

To **add a new news source**, either:

1. Run `python3 tools/submit_news_source.py` (interactive, recommended)
2. Or edit the `FEEDS` list at the top of `update_news.py` manually

**Script guide:** [tools/SUBMIT_NEWS_SOURCE_README.md](tools/SUBMIT_NEWS_SOURCE_README.md)

### Adding a New Zoom Session or Presentation

1. **For Sessions:** Edit `sessions.html` to add session details

2. **For Presentations:** Edit `presentations.html` and add a new card with:
   - Date and title
   - Speaker name
   - Description
   - Topic tags
   - Video/presentation link

### Adding a New Meeting Recap

Meeting recaps live on `meetings.html` and are ingested from Zoom, not written by hand. Two automation paths:

- **Single meeting from a VTT transcript:** `python3 tools/fetch_zoom_transcript.py` pulls the transcript from your Zoom cloud recording, then `python3 tools/add_meeting.py <note>` appends a new `<article>` block to `meetings.html`. See [tools/FETCH_ZOOM_TRANSCRIPT_README.md](tools/FETCH_ZOOM_TRANSCRIPT_README.md) and [tools/ADD_MEETING_README.md](tools/ADD_MEETING_README.md).
- **Bulk backfill from Zoom AI Companion summaries:** `python3 tools/backfill_zoom_summaries.py` imports every AI Companion summary on the account in one pass. See [tools/BACKFILL_ZOOM_SUMMARIES_README.md](tools/BACKFILL_ZOOM_SUMMARIES_README.md).

Both require Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth credentials in a local `.env` (see `.env.example`).

### Adding a New CTF

Run `python3 tools/submit_ctf.py` to add a challenge to `ctfs.html` interactively. See [tools/SUBMIT_CTF_README.md](tools/SUBMIT_CTF_README.md) for the script, or [CONTRIBUTING_CTFS.md](CONTRIBUTING_CTFS.md) for the full contribution guide.

### Adding a Glossary Term

1. Open `glossary.html` and locate the right `<h2 id="...">` section (cloud models, compute/containers, IAM, network, data, detection, posture, vuln, compliance, attack, AI, ops, standards bodies).
2. Add a new `<dt>...</dt>` + `<dd>...</dd>` pair anywhere inside that section's `<dl class="glossary-list">`. Format the headword as `ABBR - Long Form` or just `Term Name`; aliases can be separated by `/`.
3. Run `python3 tools/crosslink_glossary.py` - it will:
   - Add an `id="term-..."` to your new `<dt>`.
   - Hyperlink your new term wherever it appears in other definitions.
   - Hyperlink any existing terms that appear in your new definition.
4. Update the search-bar count and OG description if the total moved past a round number.

The script is idempotent and safe to re-run. See [tools/CROSSLINK_GLOSSARY_README.md](tools/CROSSLINK_GLOSSARY_README.md) for details.

### Customizing the Homepage

Edit the "Resource Categories" section in `index.html` to:
- Change category descriptions
- Modify call-to-action buttons
- Adjust hero section messaging

## 🤖 How Automation Works

This site uses **GitHub Actions workflows** to automate all major site updates. Every workflow file is commented line by line - they double as the teaching material behind [github-actions.html](https://csoh.org/github-actions.html), so read them if you want the full story.

The table below covers the 15 core workflows; `check-mobile-layout`, `deploy-qa`, `promote-qa`, `publish-recaps`, and `weekly-docs-review` are the remaining five (QA pipeline docs: `.github/workflows/QA_PIPELINE_README.md`). Times are UTC.

**Content automation (writes to the site)**

| Workflow | When | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`update-news.yml`](.github/workflows/update-news.yml) | every 3h | Pulls 62 RSS/Atom feeds, rewrites `news.html`, `feed.xml`, sitemap lastmod; opens a PR that auto-merges if the diff is news files only |
| [`update-resources.yml`](.github/workflows/update-resources.yml) | Mon 14:00 | `claude-code-action` adds 2-3 fresh entries per `resources.html` section; auto-merges only if the diff is `resources.html` alone |
| [`update-counts.yml`](.github/workflows/update-counts.yml) | Mon 07:30 | Recomputes every count on the site from the real cards and refreshes the count share-cards |
| [`normalize-urls.yml`](.github/workflows/normalize-urls.yml) | 1st of month, 08:00 | Deep URL-normalization pass; opens an auto-approved PR for a human to merge |
| [`site-update-deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/site-update-deploy.yml) | push to `main` on site files | Chained housekeeping commits: SRI, URL safety, normalization, schema, sitemap, previews |

**Deploy**

| Workflow | When | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) | push to `main` on site files | Builds once, publishes active/active to AWS + GCP + Azure behind Cloudflare, keyless OIDC per cloud |

**PR quality gates**

| Workflow | When | Blocks the PR? |
|---|---|---|
| [`lint.yml`](.github/workflows/lint.yml) | every push + PR | Yes - `actionlint` + `ruff` + `yamllint` |
| [`validate-html.yml`](.github/workflows/validate-html.yml) | push/PR on `*.html` + Mon 07:00 | Yes, with a PR comment - W3C HTML5 validator |
| [`check-url-safety.yml`](.github/workflows/check-url-safety.yml) | PRs on `*.html` + Mon 06:30 | Yes - phishing patterns, suspicious TLDs, shortener domains |
| [`check-broken-links.yml`](.github/workflows/check-broken-links.yml) | PRs on `*.html` + Mon 06:00 | No - lychee crawl, PR comment only (link rot is everywhere) |

**Periodic audits (report-only, never edit the site)**

| Workflow | When | Where the report lands |
|---|---|---|
| [`check-pagespeed.yml`](.github/workflows/check-pagespeed.yml) | Mon 14:00 | Row in `seo-audits/SCORECARD.md`; issue on regression |
| [`run-seo-audit.yml`](.github/workflows/run-seo-audit.yml) | Mon 14:15 | Row in `seo-audits/SCORECARD.md` + `seo-audits/YYYY-MM-DD.md`; issue on regression |
| [`check-meeting-staleness.yml`](.github/workflows/check-meeting-staleness.yml) | Mon 15:00 | Sticky issue labeled `meeting-staleness` |
| [`check-reading-list-staleness.yml`](.github/workflows/check-reading-list-staleness.yml) | 1st of month, 07:00 | Sticky issue labeled `reading-list-staleness` |
| [`check-conference-staleness.yml`](.github/workflows/check-conference-staleness.yml) | 1st of month, 14:00 | Sticky issue labeled `conference-staleness` for stale "Next:" dates on `conferences.html` |

### Site Housekeeping Workflow

**Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/site-update-deploy.yml`

**Triggers on pushes to `main` when these files change:**
- `**.html` - note the double `*`. GitHub's `*` does not match `/`, so `'*.html'`
  would mean *root-level pages only* and a commit touching just `breaches/`,
  `meetings/`, `portfolio/`, or `homelab/` would never trigger the workflow.
  That failure is silent: nothing errors, the push looks fine, and the change
  waits for the next unrelated commit.
- `style.css`, `search.css`, `breach-timeline.css`
- `main.js`, `chat-resources.js`, `breach-timeline.js`, `meetings.js`, `glossary.js`, `404.js`, `search-init.js`
- `vendor/**`, `chat-screenshots/**`, `img/**`
- `update_sri.py`
- Manual trigger via the GitHub Actions tab

Re-derive the published set with `./tools/stage_site.sh /tmp/dist && find /tmp/dist -maxdepth 1`
when you add a file, and add it to this filter *and* `deploy.yml`'s. Widening a
filter is always the safe direction: a superfluous pattern costs one redundant
deploy of identical bytes, a missing one costs a change that never goes live.

**What it does (housekeeping only - actual deploy is `deploy.yml`):**
- Updates SRI hashes and cache-busting tags if CSS/JS changed (using `update_sri.py`)
- Checks URL safety - blocks normalization if unsafe URLs are detected (using `check_all_site_urls.py`)
- Normalizes URLs - strips tracking parameters, upgrades HTTP to HTTPS, resolves redirects (using `normalize_urls.py`)
- Regenerates the `VideoObject` JSON-LD on `presentations.html` (using `update_presentations_schema.py`)
- Rebuilds the meetings.html search index
- Refreshes `<lastmod>` dates in `sitemap.xml` from git history (using `update_sitemap.py`)
- Generates preview images for new resources in `resources.html` (using `generate_preview.py`)
- Optimizes generated images
- Each step that mutates files commits the change back to `main` (with `[skip ci]` markers) so the next workflow run sees fresh state

**Why this is separate from the deploy:** these housekeeping commits carry `[skip ci]`, so they do NOT trigger `deploy.yml` (that would loop). `deploy.yml` runs independently from the original content push that started this workflow; the housekeeping commits land in `main` and ship with the next deploy. Splitting them keeps each workflow's responsibility narrow.

**News updates** are still handled by a separate scheduled workflow (`update-news.yml`) that runs every 3 hours and creates a PR with new articles. Once merged, the housekeeping workflow runs against the new content, then `deploy.yml` ships it.

### Standalone URL Normalization Workflow

**Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/normalize-urls.yml`

In addition to the URL normalization that runs as part of every deploy, a **standalone monthly workflow** performs a deeper pass across all HTML files:

- **Schedule:** Monthly on the 1st at 08:00 UTC (also available via manual trigger)
- **What it does:**
  - Checks URL safety first - blocks normalization if unsafe URLs are found
  - Strips tracking parameters (`utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, `msclkid`, etc.)
  - Upgrades HTTP links to HTTPS
  - Resolves redirecting URLs to their final destinations
- **Output:** Creates a PR with a detailed report of all changes, auto-approved for review

**Full docs:** See [tools/UPDATE_SRI_README.md](tools/UPDATE_SRI_README.md), [tools/GENERATE_PREVIEW_README.md](tools/GENERATE_PREVIEW_README.md), [tools/UPDATE_NEWS_README.md](tools/UPDATE_NEWS_README.md), and [tools/CHECK_URL_SAFETY_README.md](tools/CHECK_URL_SAFETY_README.md)

### Multi-Cloud Deploy Workflow

**Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Builds the site once, then publishes it active/active to three cloud origins behind Cloudflare. This is the workflow that actually publishes csoh.org to production.

**Triggers on pushes to `main` when these files change:** a superset of
`site-update-deploy.yml`'s filter - everything that workflow watches, plus the
generated and static files only the deploy ships:
- All of `site-update-deploy.yml`'s paths above (`**.html`, CSS, JS, `vendor/**`, images, screenshots)
- `feed.xml`, `recaps.xml`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, `humans.txt`, `manifest.json`, `csoh.ics`, `security.txt`, `.well-known/**`
- `search-synonyms.json`, `meetings-search-index.json`, `preview-mapping.json`, `email-screenshots/**`
- `Dockerfile`, `nginx.conf`, `nginx-security-headers.conf`, `infra/**`, `tools/stage_site.sh`, `tools/site-publish.filter`, `tools/build_search_index.py`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Manual trigger via the GitHub Actions tab

**What it does - build once, fan out:**
- **build:** regenerates the search index and runs `tools/stage_site.sh` to produce `dist/` (the public file set - mirrors nginx block rules + the Dockerfile strip list), uploaded as an artifact so all origins serve byte-identical content.
- **publish-aws:** assumes an IAM role via OIDC, `aws s3 sync --delete` to the private bucket, invalidates CloudFront.
- **publish-azure:** logs in via an Entra federated credential (OIDC), `az storage blob sync` into the `$web` static-website container.
- **publish-gcp:** builds the `Dockerfile` (digest-pinned `nginx:1.27-alpine` + `apk upgrade`), Trivy-scans (fails on fixable HIGH/CRITICAL), pushes an immutable SHA tag to Artifact Registry, deploys a Cloud Run revision. Auth is Workload Identity Federation - no stored key.

Every cloud uses **keyless OIDC** - no long-lived cloud credentials in the repo. Non-secret resource IDs come from repo Variables (see [infra/README.md](infra/README.md)).

**Edge in front of all three origins:** Cloudflare (Free plan + Load Balancing add-on) terminates TLS, caches, runs the WAF (free managed ruleset), sets security headers, applies legacy redirects, and load-balances active/active across the origins with health-check failover. (This replaced the old GCP Global HTTPS load balancer + Cloud Armor + Cloud CDN, which were redundant with Cloudflare and cost ~$100/mo.)

**Full architecture, cost, and cutover runbook:** [infra/README.md](infra/README.md). The full security walkthrough is the public teaching page [cloud-deployment.html](cloud-deployment.html). Security model and rotation: [SECURITY.md → Deployment Security](SECURITY.md#deployment-security).

### QA Staging Site

`qa.csoh.org` is a staging copy of the site, deployed from the **`qa` branch** to a
second Cloud Run service by `deploy-qa.yml`. `main` still means production and
still deploys the moment anything lands on it - QA is an addition, not a
redirection. Promotion is **Actions → Promote QA to production**
(`promote-qa.yml`), which fast-forwards `main`.

Work on QA in the `../csoh-qa` worktree, which stays permanently on `qa`. Do not
`git switch qa` in the main checkout - several sessions share it, and switching
moves all of them mid-task.

Four things here are deliberate and look like mistakes:

- **`deploy-qa.yml` has no `paths:` filter, on purpose.** A third filter to keep
  in step with the other two is a third chance to repeat the `'*.html'` bug
  described above. `promote-qa.yml`'s "was this commit actually QA-tested?" gate
  also depends on every push to `qa` producing a run, so a filter would make
  filtered-out commits unpromotable.
- **The QA container config must stay identical to production's.** Promotion
  reuses the image QA built, by tag, from the shared Artifact Registry repo. A
  QA-only container setting silently turns promotion back into a rebuild.
  Anything QA-specific belongs at the Cloudflare edge.
- **QA is deliberately outside the load-balancer pool.** Pool membership means
  being probed from every Cloudflare data center around the clock, and never
  scaling to zero.
- **The Host rewrite is a Worker, not an Origin Rule.** Cloud Run picks a service
  by `Host`, and Host Header Override is a paid-plan feature this zone does not
  have. The entitlement is checked at apply rather than at plan, so the config
  validates and plans cleanly and then fails.

`qa.csoh.org` sits behind Cloudflare Access, but its origin's `*.run.app`
hostname is publicly reachable exactly as production's is. Access is not a
secrecy boundary - do not stage anything there that would harm you if read early.

**Full docs**, including the ten Cloudflare token permission groups and the
registry race between the two deploy workflows:
[.github/workflows/QA_PIPELINE_README.md](.github/workflows/QA_PIPELINE_README.md).

### Setup Note

Workflows authenticate to GitHub via a **GitHub App** (`csoh-ci`) that mints short-lived (~1h) installation tokens at job start, plus a small fine-grained PAT (`CSOH_PAT`) used only to approve App-opened PRs (GitHub blocks self-approval). The full model - App config, ruleset bypass, why one PAT remains - is documented in [SECURITY.md → CI/CD Authentication](SECURITY.md#cicd-authentication). Setup / rotation steps for the PAT are in [tools/UPDATE_NEWS_README.md](tools/UPDATE_NEWS_README.md#setup-requirements).

`deploy.yml` does *not* use the GitHub App - it authenticates to each cloud via keyless OIDC (GCP Workload Identity Federation, an AWS IAM role, an Azure Entra federated credential) and only needs the auto-injected `GITHUB_TOKEN` (with `id-token: write` for the OIDC exchanges). There is no cloud-side credential to set up or rotate for any of the three.

### Weekly SEO Monitoring Workflows

Two complementary workflows run every Monday around 14:00 UTC to keep `seo-audits/SCORECARD.md` current without manual cadence. Both follow the same csoh-ci App + `CSOH_PAT` pattern as `update-news.yml`: PR-based update, auto-approved, auto-merged. The deploy and site-housekeeping workflows have path filters that exclude `seo-audits/`, so SCORECARD-only changes naturally don't trigger a redeploy. Both file a tracking issue (label `regression`) if the overall score dropped vs the previous row.

**`check-pagespeed.yml` - Mondays 14:00 UTC**

Runs `tools/check_pagespeed.py` against `https://csoh.org/` - mobile + desktop in parallel - using Google's PageSpeed Insights v5 API. Captures the four Lighthouse category scores (Performance / Accessibility / Best Practices / SEO), lab Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, TBT, FCP, Speed Index), and for any category < 100 the specific failing audit IDs plus the failing DOM nodes' CSS selectors. Appends a row to the PageSpeed Insights table in SCORECARD.md. Requires `PSI_API_KEY` repo secret (free key from [console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), restricted to "PageSpeed Insights API").

**`run-seo-audit.yml` - Mondays 14:15 UTC**

Runs `tools/run_seo_audit.py` - a deterministic structural SEO audit across every indexable HTML page (top-level + breaches + portfolio + meetings; the script counts them at runtime). Mirrors the mechanical checks the `/seo-audit` skill does: canonical, title 30-65 chars, meta description 100-165 chars, og:image ≠ banner.png, full Twitter Card, single H1, robots meta, JSON-LD presence, image alt coverage, `<html lang>`. Writes a per-day report under `seo-audits/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and appends a row to the Internal SEO audit table. Stdlib-only, no API costs, no LLM calls.

For qualitative depth (internal-linking strategy, content depth, AI visibility, topical authority) that the deterministic script can't reason about, invoke `/seo-audit` from Claude Code manually and add a row off-cycle.

**Full docs:** [tools/CHECK_PAGESPEED_README.md](tools/CHECK_PAGESPEED_README.md), [tools/RUN_SEO_AUDIT_README.md](tools/RUN_SEO_AUDIT_README.md).

### Monthly Reading-List Staleness Check

**Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/check-reading-list-staleness.yml`

Once a month, `tools/check_reading_list_staleness.py` walks every podcast / blog / newsletter / YouTube channel on `cloud-security-reading-list.html`, discovers its RSS/Atom feed, and flags anything whose newest post is older than the threshold. The reading list is hand-curated and opinionated, so this workflow **never edits the page** - it only opens (or updates) a single tracking issue with the report for a human to act on.

**Full docs:** [tools/CHECK_READING_LIST_STALENESS_README.md](tools/CHECK_READING_LIST_STALENESS_README.md).

### The other two staleness checks

Same shape, different content, and neither one edits the site either - each opens or refreshes exactly one sticky issue:

- **`check-meeting-staleness.yml`** (Mondays 15:00 UTC) runs `tools/check_meeting_staleness.py` and files an issue labeled `meeting-staleness` when the newest recap on `meetings.html` is older than the expected weekly cadence. It catches an ingest that quietly stopped working, which no other check would notice.
- **`check-conference-staleness.yml`** (1st of the month, 14:00 UTC) runs `tools/check_conference_staleness.py` over the "Next:" dates on `conferences.html` and files an issue labeled `conference-staleness` for any that have passed. Conference dates rot in place: the link still resolves, so lychee stays quiet, but the page is advertising an event that already happened. It also scans the *visible text* of cards marked `ongoing` or `TBA`, whose `data-next-date` is deliberately never compared against today - the BSides card advertised a date four days past while the check reported OK, because only the attribute was ever examined.

Both are deliberately `paths:`-filtered so that editing the content they watch does *not* re-trigger them - only the script and the workflow file do.

## 🔍 SEO & Search Optimization

CSOH is engineered for organic discovery across traditional search (Google, Bing), AI search/answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini), and social previews (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Slack). The site uses no third-party scripts and no cross-site tracking - just clean semantic HTML, structured data, disciplined metadata, and a self-hosted cookieless page-view counter (GoatCounter).

### Schema.org structured data (<!--count:schema_types_floor-->35+<!--/count--> types)

**Page-level schema** - each page declares what kind of thing it is:
- ✅ **Article** / **NewsArticle** - pillar pages and the news index, with `datePublished`, `dateModified`, `author`, `publisher`
- ✅ **HowTo** + **HowToStep** - step-by-step content (e.g. learning path, GitHub Actions guide)
- ✅ **Course** + **CourseInstance** - learning-path roadmap and certifications comparison (Google Course rich result eligible)
- ✅ **FAQPage** + **Question** / **Answer** - <!--count:faq_pages-->64<!--/count--> pages with structured Q&A for featured snippets
- ✅ **CollectionPage** - resource hub pages eligible for sitelinks rich results
- ✅ **Event** + **VirtualLocation** + **Schedule** - weekly Friday Zoom session
- ✅ **VideoObject** - each YouTube talk on `presentations.html` and meeting recaps
- ✅ **DefinedTermSet** - the glossary, with <!--count:glossary_terms-->317<!--/count--> individual terms

**Entity schema** - who/what is responsible for the content:
- ✅ **Organization** - CSOH itself, with founding date, contact point, sameAs links, search action
- ✅ **Person** + **ProfilePage** - founder bio with `jobTitle`, `worksFor`, `founder`, `knowsAbout`, `sameAs`
- ✅ **Author attribution** - pillar articles credit the Person via `@id` reference (E-E-A-T signal)
- ✅ **ItemList** - certifications comparison, news listings, and resource directories
- ✅ **BreadcrumbList** - full navigation hierarchy on every content page

### Author authority (E-E-A-T)

- ✅ Dedicated bio page at `/about-shawn-nunley.html` with full Person schema
- ✅ Visible "About the author" card at the bottom of all pillar articles (<!--count:author_card_pages-->91<!--/count--> pages and counting)
- ✅ Visible byline + footer "Founded by" link site-wide
- ✅ `rel="author"` on every author link
- ✅ `sameAs` external profile links (LinkedIn, GitHub, csoh.org)

### Discoverability

- ✅ **`sitemap.xml`** - <!--count:sitemap_urls-->266<!--/count--> URLs, `<lastmod>` refreshed from git commit dates on every deploy ([tools/update_sitemap.py](tools/update_sitemap.py))
- ✅ **`robots.txt`** - Allow: / for all major crawlers, plus explicit allow-rules for 21 AI/LLM bots (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, Applebot-Extended, CCBot, MistralAI-User, Cohere, etc.)
- ✅ **RSS feed** (`feed.xml`) for the news aggregator
- ✅ **`humans.txt`** for human-readable credits, linked via `<link rel="author">`
- ✅ **`security.txt`** (RFC 9116) for vulnerability disclosure, at both `/.well-known/security.txt` and `/security.txt`
- ✅ Site-wide **canonical URLs** to consolidate ranking signals
- ✅ **Glossary cross-linking** - first occurrence of each of <!--count:glossary_terms-->317<!--/count--> terms auto-linked to the glossary on every content page ([tools/crosslink_pages.py](tools/crosslink_pages.py))

### Social previews

- ✅ **Open Graph** + **Twitter Card** meta on every indexable page (title, description, type, url, image)
- ✅ **Per-article social images** - <!--count:og_images-->250<!--/count--> unique 1200×630 JPG previews under `img/og/` (top-level pages via [tools/generate_og_images.py](tools/generate_og_images.py), plus `img/og/breaches/`, `img/og/portfolio/`, and <!--count:meetings-->107<!--/count--> meeting recaps in `img/og/meetings/` via [tools/generate_meeting_og_images.py](tools/generate_meeting_og_images.py)) so each page has its own LinkedIn/Slack/Twitter preview, not a generic site banner
- ✅ **`og:type`: profile** on the bio page with `profile:first_name` / `profile:last_name`

### Performance signals (Core Web Vitals)

- ✅ **WebP everywhere** - homepage banner, all <!--count:news_banners-->58<!--/count--> news-source banners, and the author photo all serve WebP via `<picture>` with JPG/PNG fallback (≈40-60% smaller payloads)
- ✅ **`<link rel="preload">`** for critical CSS, with **SRI integrity hashes** auto-updated on every deploy
- ✅ **`loading="lazy"`** on below-the-fold images
- ✅ **`width` / `height`** attributes on every `<img>` to prevent CLS
- ✅ **`decoding="async"`** on hero images
- ✅ **PWA manifest** (`manifest.json`) + 192/512 maskable icons → "Add to Home Screen" eligible

### Content optimization discipline

- ✅ Title tags 45-60 chars, meta descriptions 120-160 chars on every indexable page
- ✅ One `<h1>` per page, semantic heading hierarchy
- ✅ `alt` text on every content image
- ✅ Skip links + ARIA labels for accessibility (which Google increasingly weighs)
- ✅ `lang="en"` on `<html>` for international targeting

### Privacy as an SEO signal

- ✅ Zero cookies, zero cross-site trackers, zero third-party scripts (analytics is cookieless, self-hosted GoatCounter)
- ✅ Strict Content-Security-Policy
- ✅ HSTS preload-eligible
- ✅ All external scripts blocked at the CSP layer

The result: rich-snippet eligibility across Google's full catalog of result types, full author entity wiring for E-E-A-T, AI-search citation eligibility, and Core Web Vitals headroom from a static-HTML stack with no JS frameworks.
